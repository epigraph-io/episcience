-- migrations/026_graph_neighborhoods.sql
-- Per-theme Louvain communities for the graph visualizer drilldown.
--
-- NUMBERING NOTE (2026-04-30): the live production DB tracks migrations
-- through a separate `_sqlx_migrations` table (numeric IDs, descriptive
-- names) that diverges from the file-based 001-023 lineage in this repo.
-- This migration is numbered 024 to follow the file-based lineage; when
-- this branch is merged and the live DB is reconciled with file-based
-- migrations, this file may need to be renumbered (or wrapped in an
-- equivalent _sqlx_migrations entry) to land cleanly on production.
